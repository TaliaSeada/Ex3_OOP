# Third Assignment - OOP Course
## Credits:
This Project made by: Talia Seada (ID: 211551601) and Lior Breitman (ID: 212733257). <br>
__NOTE:__ In this projects the group members used "Code With Me" in the Pycharm workspace, so most of the commits are
from one main computer, while all the members were working on the project together.
## Intro:
This project is about Weighted Directional Graphs. <br>
For more information - https://github.com/benmoshe/OOP_2021/tree/main/Assignments/Ex3 <br>

### The main Task:
The main task of this project is to run and display algorithms on Directed Weighted Graphs.
We achieved it by implementing these four main algorithms: <br>

### GUI:
When running the plot_graph() in the GraphAlgo class we get here. <br>
How to use the buttons:
1. Reset changes button : This button reset the graph to the default. 
2. Center button : This button prints the center node on the graph.
3. ShortestPath button : This button ask from the user to insert two nodes (integers) and print the shortest path on the graph.
4. TSP button : This button ask from the user to insert two or more nodes (integers) and print the TSP path on the graph.

### Results:
Time of running each algorithm in each graph (name), when time is in nanoseconds.
